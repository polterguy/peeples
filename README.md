# Peeples, the user management module for Phosphorus Five

This is a module for [Phosphorus Five](https://github.com/polterguy/phosphorusfive), that allows you to
manage your users. It allows you to create, edit, and delete users in your Phosphorus Five installation.

If you wish to have multiple users in your Phosphorus Five installation, this is probably your choice
of module.

### Getting started

Once it's out of its BETA stage, you should be able to automatically install it in your P5 system, by
visiting the Bazar of your server. The module should be fairly self explaining.

### User tickets

The system allows you to create 5 initial users for free. If you wish to create more users, you'll
have to purchase additional _"user tickets"_.
